# learning-log
Learning Log is a simple web application built using Django that allows users to keep a personal journal of what they are learning about various topics. Users can register for an account, create topics they are interested in, and make entries describing what theyâ€™ve learned. Each entry is tied to a specific topic and timestamped for future reference.

This project is based on the Web Application project from the book Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition by Eric Matthes (No Starch Press, 2023). It follows the tutorials in Chapters 18, 19, and 20 of the book. The purpose of this project is strictly educational. It was created as a learning exercise to understand the basics of Django and web development.
